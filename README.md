# ApplyTrack
Internship &amp; Job Application Tracking System

## Vision Document

### Project Name:
ApplyTrack - Internship and Job Application Tracking System

### Overview:
A web-based application tracking system that provides to students and job seekers a unified platform to monitor application status, review past applications, identify suitable opportunities and respond to updates in a timely manner. It also allows recruiters to manage large volumes of applications efficiently, enforce deadlines and communicate updates to applicants.

### Problem It Solves:
There is no unified, user-centric system that enables applicants to track applications, monitor application status and receive timely notifications, while also allowing recruiters to post opportunities, review applications, and manage application lifecycles efficiently. The absence of such a centralized platform leads to missed deadlines, poor visibility of application outcomes and inefficient communication between applicants and recruiters.

### Target Users:
1. Primary Users: Students and Job Applicants
2. Secondary Users: Recruiters, Administrator
3. System Users: Notification System

### Vision Statement:
ApplyTrack aims to become a user-friendly and trustworthy platform that helps applicants manage their job and internship applications in one place. It focuses on improving transparency and organization through real-time tracking and personalized recommendations.

### Key Features/Goals:
Develop a lightweight, web-based Application Tracking System (ATS) that provides a centralized platform for managing internship and job applications by supporting the following:

1. Allow applicants to create and manage user accounts containing personal details and application history
2. Enable applicants to view applicable opportunities and receive recommended opportunities based on profile details
3. Allow applicants to apply for opportunities, track application status, and view results when published
4. Provide recruiters with functionality to post opportunities, view submitted applications, and manage application status
5. Enable administrators to manage user accounts, opportunities, and overall system activity
6. Integrate a notification mechanism to inform users about application updates, deadlines, and system events

### Success Metrics:

1. Applicants can successfully manage and track applications
2. Recruiters can post and manage opportunities efficiently
3. Notifications are delivered accurately and on time
4. The system reflects correct application statuses and results
5. At least 80% of test users can use the system without assistance
6. The project is completed within the defined timeline

### Assumptions:

1 .Users have access to a web browser and internet connectivity
2. Applicants are willing to maintain their application records
3. Recruiters will update application statuses when required
4. The notification system is available and operational

### Constraints:

1. Only open-source tools and technologies will be used
2. The system must be scalable enough to support multiple users
3. User data must be handled securely and confidentially
4. The system must be developed within the given timeframe
